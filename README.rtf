\f0\fs24 \cf0 Use Linux to run\
We used a window size of 4 to transmit our packets. We did everything that the HW assignment specified, but we didn\'92t do the \'93congestion window\'94 extra credit. \
Packets each contain 3 random numbers from 1~999. When finished transmitting, both the server and client will show all the numbers in each packet transmitted.\
\
\
1. Compile both the server and client cpp file\
	g++ server.cpp -o server\
	g++ client.cpp -o client\
\
2. Make sure the port numbers are the same and which IP address you are on.\
	\
\
3. Run both of the Unix Executable in two different windows.\
	(Important!: Number of packets cannot exceed 100, because of the packet array size we set. If 	you want to send more, we can change it.)\
	./server <port num> <number of packets to send(1~100)>\
\
	./client <IP address> <port num(1~100)>\
